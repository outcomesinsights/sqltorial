## Example 1: This is the title of the example



 And here is the first query

**Query 1.1**

```sql
SELECT
  1 AS column_header
;
```

Found 1 results.

| column_header |
| ------------------: |
| 1 |


 You can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to:

 - Format your comments

 - Highlight things in **bold**

 - And make lists like this one, though the formatting is a bit odd.  I'm looking into it.

 And they'll appear above your next query like this query:

**Query 1.2**

```sql
SELECT
  'hey' AS some_name_for_column
;
```

Found 1 results.

| some_name_for_column |
| :----------------------------- |
| hey |
