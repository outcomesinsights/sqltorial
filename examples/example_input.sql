-- You can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to:
--
-- - Format your comments
--
-- - Highlight things in **bold**
--
-- - And make lists like this one, though the formatting is a bit odd.  I'm looking into it.
--
-- And they'll appear above your next query like this query:
SELECT 'hey' as some_name_for_column;
